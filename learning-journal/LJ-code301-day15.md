# LJ Code 301 - Day 15

Today we had an oppurtinty of debugging the the blog app. We noticed that once we select an author on the filter the css highlight.js library was getting broken. Megan then identified that we were missing some forward slashes on some of our src paths. Following this the filter drop down doesn't get populated after selecting an author, it was brought up that this might be due to the '/articles/find' route returning only the filtered rows.

In the afternoon we started our Project Week. We completed our project proposal and presented it to the TAs and Sam.
