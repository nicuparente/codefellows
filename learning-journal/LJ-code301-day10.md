# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

### Quick Summary
We should try to write code in a functional manner when contributing to a project however if we want to understand what is going on behind the scenes we should write code in an imperative way


---
**SQL JOINS** - allow us to query and combine multiple tables to create more robust results

### TERMS
 - **IIFE** - IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
 - **IMPERATIVE METHOD** - Very verbose programming
 - **DECLARATIVE METHOD** - Much more functional
 - **STATELESS FUNCTION** - just has a return
 - **STATEFUL FUNCTION** - Depends on an external function or has other code in it
 - **FAT ARROW FUNCTIONS** - Short hand for anonymous functions

``` javascript
//Anonymous function
function(a){
  return a*2
}

//Lambda functions
(a) => a*2
```
